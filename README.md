# Code Class Animation Worklet

The underlying CSS Houdini API that is used for animations.    
In this class we will learn about the API, what it is compared to WAAPI and how to use it.

## Getting started

This project is hosted as a Voorhoede Git repository. Clone it:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:voorhoede/code-class-template.git
```

Install dependencies:

``` bash
$ npm install
```

Start server & watch files:

``` bash
$ npm run start
```

This wil build the project, start the server and start the watcher. The project is
available on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The watcher task will automatically
build assets, styles and views. The server will be reloaded on every change.

__Before you can use the Animation Worklet, you will have to enable the experimental features flag in chrome,
 go to [chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features) and enable it__
